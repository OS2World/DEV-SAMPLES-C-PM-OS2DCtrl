This zip file demonstrates how to create a custom control.  It was written
in conjunction with an article in the Winter '93 edition of the OS/2
Developer.  All of the files required to run and/or build the demo are
included.  IBMC.ZIP contains files to use with the IBM CSET/2 Compiler.
Whereas, WATCOMC.ZIP contains files to use with the WATCOM C/386 compiler.
TESTBED.ZIP contains the "application" code that drives the custom control.
For more information on OS/2 and related products, call 1-800-3IBMOS2.
